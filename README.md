Tree diameter growth model for Adirondacks

Models annualized tree diameter growth in New York's Adirondack region, based on multiple site- and tree- specific variables. Created using data from the US Forest Service's FIA program. See attached report for additional information.

_**WARNING:**_ This analysis used diameter growth rates reported in the FIA database for the response variable, which were actually predictions of growth rates, not measured growth rates. The model described is invalid. Please do not cite this work.
