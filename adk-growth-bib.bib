	abstract = {One of the pivotal objectives in forestry research is to estimate the response of silvicultural target variables to climate change scenarios at high temporal resolution in order to consider within-year feedbacks between growth and environmental conditions. To meet this challenge, models are needed which support and complement the widely used observation-based decision systems in forest management and consulting. Physiological models in particular provide the fundamental prerequisites to reflect the impact of various simultaneously changing environmental conditions. However, a physiological representation at the individual tree level is computationally very expensive and sensitive to uncertain initializations. We thus propose an approach that combines a modern representative of the physiological cohort model type, MoBiLE-PSIM, with the individual tree competition concept of a distance-dependent empirical growth simulator (SILVA). The resulting hybrid provides a key feature for the consideration of forest management in long-term simulations at high computational efficiency. The extended model was evaluated with growth-diameter distributions obtained from core-boring at two beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest sites in south-west Germany that differ in exposure and soil conditions. The mean bias of annual stand-scale growth from 2001 to 2007 decreased from −0.59 to −0.41 mm at one evaluation plot and from −0.55 to −0.24 mm at the other when the competition module was coupled in. Inclusion of the SILVA-based individual tree module into MoBiLE-PSIM improved the size-dependent representation of competition and growth on five-year and even annual timescale. This was particularly the case where the spatial distribution of dominant trees was clustered.},

	abstract = {• It is widely believed that distance-independent tree models fail to take into account the complexity of mixed stands due to the fact that spatial structure often has a greater impact on growth and dynamics in mixed stands than in pure stands. On the other hand, distance-dependent tree models are difficult to use because they require a map of the stand, which is not only very costly but also impracticable in a routine management context.• This paper reports the development of a model bridging distance-dependent and distance-independent tree models, and that is designed to simulate the growth of a mixed forest. The model used distributions of the number of neighbours to reconstruct tree neighbourhoods and compute the competition indices needed as inputs to the growth model. • Data were collected from a mixed forest of sessile oak and Scots pine in central France. The study showed that local competition indices explained a significant proportion of growth variability and that intraspecific competition was greater than interspecific competition. The model based on neighbourhood distributions gave consistent predictions compared to a distance-dependent model.• This type of model could be used instead of distance-dependent models in management contexts., • On considère généralement que les modèles arbre indépendant des distances ne permettent pas de rendre compte de la complexité des peuplements mélangés. En effet, la structure spatiale a souvent un rôle plus important sur la croissance et la dynamique dans ces peuplements que dans les peuplements purs. Les modèles arbre dépendant des distances sont quant à eux difficile à utiliser, car ils nécessitent une cartographie du peuplement qui est une information très coûteuse à obtenir et qui n’est pas disponible dans un cadre de gestion courante.• Cet article présente un modèle intermédiaire entre un modèle arbre indépendant des distances et un modèle arbre dépendant des distances. Ce modèle a été développé pour simuler la croissance de peuplements mélangés. Il utilise des distributions de nombre de voisins pour reconstruire le voisinage des arbres. Ces voisinages reconstruits permettent ensuite de calculer les indices de compétition nécessaires dans l’équation de croissance.• Les données ont été récoltées dans des peuplements mélangés de chêne sessile et de pin sylvestre dans le centre de la France. Ce travail montre que des indices de compétition locaux expliquent une part significative de la croissance individuelle et que la compétition intraspécifique est supérieure à la compétition interspécifique. Le modèle basé sur les distributions de voisinage donne des prédictions cohérentes par rapport au modèle arbre dépendant des distances.• Ce type de modèle pourrait être utilisé à la place des modèles arbre dépendant des distances dans des contextes de gestion.},

Data were collected from 221 destructively sampled trees in eight second-growth stands on above-average sites. The single best independent variable for predicting basal area growth was the projection area of the exposed portion of the crown, which had higher correlations with observed growth than initial stem diameter, diameter-based competition indices, and other crown variables. Basal area growth equations containing total crown projection area, percent exposed crown area, and relative height had R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.88, which represent increases of 13 to 47 percentage points compared with similar equations with only diameter-based competition variables. The most accurate height growth models were functions of total tree height and percent exposed crown area, with R2 values of 0.74 for the non-linear maple equation and 0.44 for the linear white ash equation. The results appear to support the hypothesis that significant competitive stress on individual trees is induced only by the ring of competitor trees immediately surrounding the subject tree crown. By using percent exposed crown area as a crown competition variable, this competitive effect can be estimated without direct measurements of any of the competitors, potentially saving much field measurement time during the model calibration phase and eliminating the statistical lack of independence generally associated with plot competition measures.},

	abstract = {Forest gap models, initially conceived in 1969 as a special case of individual-tree based models, have become widely popular among forest ecologists for addressing a large number of applied research questions, including the impacts of global change on long-term dynamics of forest structure, biomass, and composition. However, they have been strongly criticized for a number of weaknesses inherent in the original model structure. In this paper, I review the fundamental assumptions underlying forest gap models, the structure of the parent model JABOWA, and examine these criticisms in the context of the many alternative formulations that have been developed over the past 30 years.Four assumptions originally underlie gap models: (1) The forest is abstracted as a composite of many small patches of land, where each can have a different age and successional stage; (2) patches are horizontally homogeneous, i.e., tree position within a patch is not considered; (3) the leaves of each tree are located in an indefinitely thin layer (disk) at the top of the stem; and (4) successional processes are described on each patch separately, i.e., there are no interactions between patches. These simplifications made it possible to consider mixed-species, mixed-age forests, which had been difficult previously mainly because of computing limitations.The structure of JABOWA is analysed in terms of the functional relationships used for formulating the processes of tree establishment, growth, and mortality. It is concluded that JABOWA contains a number of unrealistic assumptions that have not been questioned strongly to date. At the same time, some aspects of JABOWA that were criticized strongly in the past years are internally consistent given the objectives of this specific model.A wide variety of formulations for growth processes, establishment, and mortality factors have been developed in gap models over the past 30 years, and modern gap models include more robust parameterizations of environmental influences on tree growth and population dynamics as compared to JABOWA. Approaches taken in more recent models that led to the relaxation of one or several of the four basic assumptions are discussed. It is found that the original assumptions often have been replaced by alternatives; however, no systematic analysis of the behavioral effects of these conceptual changes has been attempted to date.The feasibility of including more physiological detail (instead of using relatively simple parameterizations) in forest gap models is discussed, and it is concluded that we often lack the data base to implement such approaches for more than a few commercially important tree species. Hence, it is important to find a compromise between using simplistic parameterizations and expanding gap models with physiology-based functions and parameters that are difficult to estimate. While the modeling of tree growth has received a lot of attention over the past years, much less effort has been spent on improving the formulations of tree establishment and mortality, although these processes are likely to be just as sensitive to global change as tree growth itself. Finally, model validation issues are discussed, and it is found that there is no single data source that can reliably be used for evaluating the behavior of forest gap models; instead, I propose a combination of sensitivity analyses, qualitative examinations of process formulations, and quantitative tests of gap models or selected submodels against various kinds of empirical data to evaluate the usefulness of these models for assessing their utility for predicting the impacts of global change on long-term forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {A density-dependent matrix model of stand growth is presented. The model was calibrated with re-measured plots in the northern hardwood forests in Wisconsin. Trees were divided into shade-tolerant, intermediate, and shade-intolerant species in twelve diameter classes. Model predictions were tested against post-sample observations for short-term (15-year) and long-term (steady-state) accuracy. This growth model was then applied to study stand growth dynamics with and without management. Starting with the current average stand state, the predicted stand basal area of an unmanaged stand rose steadily to a maximum, dropped gradually, and finally reached a steady state. The time paths of basal area and tree size diversity were highly and positively correlated. Instead, tree species diversity decreased when size diversity and basal area increased, and vice-versa. When harvesting was introduced, it was found that more intensive harvest increased the diversity of tree species, while decreasing the diversity of tree size. A 20-year cutting cycle could produce higher economic returns than a 10-year cutting cycle, with similar size and species diversity. Harvesting most of the saw timbers every 20 years could be a good compromise between economics and tree diversity, at the stand level.},

	abstract = {Plant interactions can be defined as the ways plants act upon the growth, fitness, survival and reproduction of other plants, largely by modifying their environment. These interactions can be positive (facilitation) or negative (competition or exploitation). During plantation establishment or natural forest regeneration after a disturbance, high light levels and, sometimes, increased availability of water and nutrients favour the development of opportunistic, fast-growing herbaceous and woody species which capture resources at the expense of crop trees. As a consequence, the growth and survival of crop trees can be dramatically reduced. Although the effects of this competition are well documented, the physical and physiological mechanisms of competition are not. Moreover, the competition process is never constant in time or space. We present a conceptual competition model based on plant growth forms common in global forests, i.e. graminoids, forbs, small shrubs, large shrubs and mid-storey trees, and main-storey trees. Their competitive attributes and successional dynamics are examined. An overview is presented on the way forest vegetation management (FVM) treatments influence these components and outcomes regarding crop tree performance and diversity conservation. Finally, a synthesis of literature yields FVM guidelines for efficiently optimizing crop tree performance and safeguarding diversity. Future research needs to further sustainable FVM are presented.},

Because residual tree growth is affected by tree removal, growth simulators must be coupled with a harvest model to adequately predict future stand development. Harvest models may consider variables such as species, diameter at breast height (DBH), spatial coordinates of the trees and indicators of stem quality and vigour. Through the development of a harvest model applicable to selection cuttings in northern hardwood stands, we aimed to quantify the loss of accuracy caused by the omission of either tree spatial coordinates or tree quality/vigour descriptors from the predictor variables. Spatial correlations were handled using both generalized linear mixed-effect models and a copula approach. Tree vigour and quality were assessed using three different classification systems used in practice. The inclusion of tree vigour and spatial correlations through the copula approach led to a 12 per cent improvement in maximum log-likelihood. However, the inclusion of the spatial coordinates of each tree only accounted for one quarter of this 12 per cent. In cases where a growth simulator uses tree vigour class as input, we recommend the inclusion of this variable in the associated harvest sub-model.},

This hypothesis was tested in this study.• Material and methodsWe used a single-tree growth model that can be implemented either stochastically or deterministically. Two data sets of 186 and 342 plots each were used for the comparisons. For each plot, the simulations were run on a 100-year period using 10-year growth steps. Three different response variables were compared.• ResultsThe results showed that there were differences between the predictions from stochastic and deterministic simulations for some response variables and that randomness alone could not explain these differences. In the case of deterministic simulations, the fact that predictions are reinserted into the model at each growth step is a concern. These predictions are actually random variables and their transformations may result in biased quantities. Forest growth modellers should be aware that deterministic simulations may not correspond to the mathematical expectation of the natural dynamics.},

Stem quality generally improved with d.b.h. and stand basal area. Changes in hardwood stem quality were strongly related to initial stem quality, with most trees retaining their initial quality over time.

Using these classes can simplify the tree selection process, but some classification systems may include superfluous classes beyond what is required to explain the variation in tree value. In this paper, we present a parsimonious classification system for sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) trees using formal classification analyses of empirical product recovery data. We also calculated the net value of trees in each class and assessed which defects affect tree value. Our results show that relatively few defects affect tree value, indicating that treemarkers should use a simpler classifica..., Dans les forêts de feuillus nordiques, les marteleurs sont responsables du choix des arbres à prélever lors des opérations commerciales de récolte. Ils choisissent souvent les arbres en fonction de la présence et de la gravité des défauts; cette information est ensuite utilisée pour assigner les arbres à deux ou plusieurs classes de vigueur (reflétant le risque de mortalité ou de déclin de la croissance) et à deux ou plusieurs classes de qualité (reflétant la possibilité de prélever des billes de sciage de valeur). L’utilisation de ces classes peut simplifier le processus de sélection des arbres, mais certains systèmes de classification peuvent inclure des classes superflues qui vont au-delà de ce qui est nécessaire pour expliquer la variation de la valeur des arbres.

	abstract = {The raw material properties of wood develop as the tree grows, laying down wood cells with specific properties, and forming the stem structure that is the basis of timber quality. This development is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and forest management practices. It is desirable in growth and yield models intended for the economic assessment of management practices to include some indication of wood quality and how it is affected by genetics, environmental factors and silvicultural measures. In forestry, understanding the development and variation of wood quality is important for different management and planning problems which can be broadly classified under (1) management for harvest operations, and (2) long-term silvicultural planning. This paper reviews approaches and models that allow us to study these two problems in quantitative terms. We start the review by discussing the concept of «wood quality model», then classify the approaches on the basis of their complexity, underlying principle and intended application. We illustrate three advanced dynamic quality models and their applications with example case studies. These include empirical, hybrid, and mechanistic models applied to predictions of both sawn timber and fibre properties. Finally, we consider the current challenges for wood quality modelling in connection with forest management.},

	abstract = {Global climate is changing due to increasing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Forest managers need growth and yield models that can be used to predict future forest dynamics during the transition period of present-day forests under a changing climatic regime. In this study, we developed a forest growth and yield model that can be used to predict individual-tree growth under current and projected future climatic conditions. The model was constructed by integrating historical tree growth records with predictions from an ecological process-based model using neural networks. The new model predicts basal area (BA) and volume growth for individual trees in pure or mixed species forests. For model development, tree-growth data under current climatic conditions were obtained using over 3000 permanent sample plots from the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Data to reflect tree growth under a changing climatic regime were projected with JABOWA-3 (an ecological process-based model). Model validation with designated data produced model efficiencies of 0.82 and 0.89 in predicting individual-tree BA and volume growth. Model efficiency is a relative index of model performance, where 1 indicates an ideal fit, while values lower than zero means the predictions are no better than the average of the observations. Overall mean prediction error (BIAS) of basal area and volume growth predictions was nominal (i.e., for BA: -0.0177 cm2 5-year-1 and volume: 0.0008 m3 5-year-1). Model variability described by root mean squared error (RMSE) in basal area prediction was 40.53 cm2 5-year-1 and 0.0393 m3 5-year-1 in volume prediction. The new modelling approach has potential to reduce uncertainties in growth and yield predictions under different climate change scenarios. This novel approach provides an avenue for forest managers to generate required information for the management of forests in transitional periods of climate change. Artificial intelligence technology has substantial potential in forest modelling.},

	abstract = {Empirical growth and yield models developed from historical data are commonly used in developing long-term strategic forest management plans. Use of these models rests on an assumption that there will be no future change in the tree growing environment. However, major impacts on forest growing conditions are expected to occur with climate change. As a result, there is a pressing need for tools capable of incorporating outcomes of climate change in their predictions of forest growth and yield. Process-based models have this capability and may, therefore, help to satisfy this requirement. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of an ecological, individual-tree-based model (JABOWA-3) in generating forest growth and yield projections for diverse forest conditions across Nova Scotia, Canada. Model prediction accuracy was analyzed statistically by comparing modelled with observed basal area and merchantable volume changes for 35 permanent sample plots (PSPs) measured over periods of at least 25 years. Generally, modelled basal area and merchantable volume agreed fairly well with observed data, yielding coefficients of determination (r2) of 0.97 and 0.94 and model efficiencies (ME) of 0.96 and 0.93, respectively. A Chi-square test was performed to assess model accuracy with respect to changes in species composition. We found that 83\% of species-growth trajectories based on measured basal area were adequately modelled with JABOWA-3 (P {\textgreater} 0.9). Model-prediction accuracy, however, was substantially reduced for those PSPs altered by some level of disturbance. In general, JABOWA-3 is much better at providing forest yield predictions, subject to the availability of suitable climatic and soil information.},

	abstract = {Forest growth simulators go beyond a mere tabulation of empirical measurements by employing biometric models that functionally describe the dependence of forest growth of the initial forest structure, growth conditions and management regime. This makes them very flexible and allows predicting growth reactions for unknown and/or complex forest growth scenarios. When simulation outcomes are to be used in silvicultural strategic planning, the results are of direct and delicate importance, and the correct simulator performance must be ascertained. This is especially so when the considered forest situation differs from the forest data used to parameterise the model (e.g. different geographical region). In this article, the forest growth simulator SILVA (version 2.2) was validated for 55 long-term experimental plots of mature mixed Silver fir–Norway spruce stands in southwest Germany (Picea abies, Abies alba). The evaluation was restricted to the upper canopy trees during the survey period 1989–2004. Following the general evaluation criteria for ecological models from [Vanclay, J.K., Skovsgaard, J.P., 1997. Evaluating forest growth models. Ecol. Mod. 98, 1–12], a specific methodology was developed to evaluate the simulated height and diameter growth on the basis of forest growth principles. The qualitative analysis proved the SILVA growth algorithms to be in accordance with physiologically based standard growth equations. The quantitative evaluation was limited by incomplete knowledge of the site conditions. To overcome this problem, the experimental plots were regarded as a “heterogeneous growth series” which allows analysing the growth behaviour in a more general way. It could be shown that for the given data set, the SILVA simulations produced an overestimation of height growth (median: +61\% spruce, +12\% fir), and an underestimation of diameter growth and competition sensitivity (median: −16\% spruce, −70\% fir). The errors partially compensated in the volume growth resulting in an overall over-/underestimation of +9\% for spruce and −58\% for fir (median). The unbalanced height and diameter growth cannot be compensated by a change in the site conditions because this affects both height and diameter growth either positive or negative. Hence, an adjustment of selected parameterisation values appears to offer the best solution to adapt SILVA to the considered forest situation. This approach of adaptive parameterisation is discussed against a more general background of deductive vs. inductive forest growth modelling.},

They are commonly applied in the United States but they are rarely used in European forest management yet. One of the few exceptions is the simulator SILVA, which is presented in this paper. The underlying equations of this simulator are developed from a set of more than 155,000 tree observations, including the species Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl.). These basic model equations are presented together with respective parameter values, derived from the aforesaid data set. The benefits of SILVA for forest practice, research, and education are demonstrated with three exemplary applications. Evaluation in terms of biological plausibility, validation, and practical use of the implemented software is presented, which shows that: (1) biological principles could be represented without explicitly being implemented, and (2) the simulation results are very close to independent observations as far as the range of parameterized site conditions is not exceeded. Furthermore, possible implications of changing conditions or an application of the model across a wider geographical range are discussed with special reference to the ongoing process of parameterization.},

	abstract = {With a view toward understanding species-specific differences in juvenile tree mortality and the community-level implications of these differences, we characterized juvenile survivorship of 10 dominant tree species of oak transition-northern hardwood forests using species-specific mathematical models. The mortality models predict a sapling's probability of dying as a function of its recent growth history. These models and species-specific growth functions (published elsewhere), characterize a species' shade tolerance. Combined growth and mortality models express a sapling's probability of mortality as a function of light availability. We describe the statistical bases and the field methods used to calibrate the mortality models. We examined inter- and intraspecific variation in juvenile mortality across three sites: Great Mountain Forest (low pH, nutrient poor soils) in northwestern Connecticut, a calcareous bedrock region (neutral pH, nutrient rich soils) also in northwestern Connecticut, and a site in central-western Michigan (low pH, nutrient poor soils). Interspecific differences in juvenile mortality have profound effects on community dynamics and composition; the importance of these effects is demonstrated through a spatially explicit simulator of forest dynamics (SORTIE). The 10 species we examined occupy a continuum of survivorship levels at 1\% of full sun. There was surprisingly little intraspecific variation in mortality functions for sugar maple, American beech, eastern hemlock, and white ash between the Great Mountain and Michigan sites. However, there was a striking increase in survivorship for sugar maple in the calcareous site. Differences in survivorship among the sites are correlated with soil pH and presumably nutrient availability. Growth rates in high-light and low-light survivorship are inversely correlated across species; as level of shade tolerance increases, a species grows more slowly in high light and exhibits increased survivorship under low light. Our results indicate that interspecific differences in sapling mortality are critical components of forest community dynamics.},

	abstract = {We present a critical review of current trends in research of spatio-temporal development of forests. The paper addresses (1) field methods for the development of spatially-explicit models of forest dynamics and their integration in models of forest dynamics, (2) strengths and limitations of traditional patch models versus spatiallyexplicit, individual-based models, and (3) the potential for moment-based methods in the analysis of forest dynamics. These topics are discussed with reference to their potential for solving open questions in the studies of forest dynamics. The study of spatio-temporal processes provides a link between pattern and process in plant communities, and plays a crucial role in understanding ecosystem dynamics. In the last decade, the development of spatially-explicit, individual-based models shifted the focus of forest dynamics modelling from the dynamics of discrete patches to the interactions among individual organisms, thus encapsulating the theory of ‘‘neighbourhood’’ dynamics. In turn, the stochastic properties and the complexity of spatially-explicit, individual-based models gave rise to the development of a new suite of so-called moment-based models. These new models describe the dynamics of individuals and of pairs of individuals in terms of their densities, thus directly capturing second-order information on spatial structure. So far, this approach has not been applied to forests; we indicate extensions needed for such applications. Moment-based models may be an important complement to spatially explicit individual-based models in developing a general spatial theory of forest dynamics. However, both kinds of models currently focus on fine scales, whereas a critical issue in forest dynamics is to understand the interaction of fine-scale processes with coarser-scale disturbances. To obtain a more complete picture of forest dynamics, the relevant links and interactions between fine-, intermediate-, and coarse-scale processes ought to be identified. Intensive links between modelling work and field studies designed across different scales are a promising means to create a new perspective on forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {The belief that canopy gaps are important for the maintenance of tree species diversity appears to be widespread, but there have been no formal theoretical models to assess under what conditions gap phase processes allow coexistence. Much of the empirical research on niche diff erentiation in response to gaps has focused on evidence for an interspecific tradeoff between low light survival and high light growth. The objectives of this study are first to distinguish the possible mechanisms allowing coexistence based on this tradeoff, and second, to explore their limitations. We present a theory of forest dynamics driven by small-scale disturbances as a special case of the theory of coexistence in variable environments. We demonstrate that temporal and spatial heterogeneity in light conditions that results from canopy gaps can allow stable coexistence as a result of three previously documented general mechanisms: ‘relative non-linearity’, ‘the successional niche’ and the ‘storage eff ect’. We find that temporal fluctuations in light availability alone allow the stable coexistence of only two species. Spatial variation in disturbance synchronicity and intensity allows three species to coexist in a narrow parameter space. The rate of extinction is, however, extremely slow and there is transient coexistence of a larger number of species for a long period of time. We conclude that while the low light survival/high light growth tradeoff may be ubiquitous in forest tree species, it is unlikely to function as an important mechanism for the stable coexistence of several tree species.},

To conserve forest complexity and biodiversity, silviculture and forest management should change the reference paradigm and consider forest ecosystems as complex biological systems characterized by the inherent unpredictability of their trajectories in a continuously changing environment. The new Management Plan for the Vallombrosa Forest (Florence, Italy), a State Nature Reserve and a Natura 2000 Site, is based on this approach. The aim is the gradual evolution of the pure silver fir stands toward mixed stands with a complex structure. Most of the species considered by Natura 2000 depend on an increase of structural diversity at different space and time scales. The management approach proposed by the new plan is coherent with this aim and thus biodiversity conservation is not in conflict with forest management but is, instead, a direct consequence of the systemic approach.},

A common global trend in forestry is development of new silvicultural approaches as alternatives to plantation forestry that bear names that include the words ‘nature’, ‘ecological’ or some other positive expression regarding their intent or effects. Some approaches are attempting to emulate natural processes and others to minimize disturbance effects in an attempt to be more natural. In any case, the effects of climate changes, non-native plants, insects, pathogens and animals, and other anthropogenic effects are creating novel forest ecosystems where the silviculture of the past may not be appropriate. It should be recognized that forestry has always attempted to manage stands to meet objectives in ways that would not be similarly met without management. Rather than acquiescing to pressures to follow a nature-based model based on the past, we need to recognize that our forest ecosystems are changing and the rate of change may accelerate in the future. Natural processes and stand structures are important information about natural systems, but not necessarily for the management of these changing systems. Management of these novel ecosystems to meet societal needs will have to be novel. Rather than striving to be close to a nature that is under constant change, silviculture should strive to be better than nature. ‘Close-to-nature’ is flawed in both its intent to emulate nature and as a means to meet shifting ecological conditions and societal needs.},

In this review, we identify and evaluate six principles for enhancing the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests in a changing climate: (1) increase tree species richness, (2) increase structural diversity, (3) maintain and increase genetic variation within tree species, (4) increase resistance of individual trees to biotic and abiotic stress, (5) replace high-risk stands and (6) keep average growing stocks low. We use these principles to examine how three CNS systems (single-tree selection, group selection and shelterwood) serve adaptation strategies. Many attributes of CNS can increase the adaptive capacity of European temperate forests to a changing climate. CNS promotes structural diversity and tree resistance to stressors, and growing stocks can be kept at low levels. However, some deficiencies exist in relation to the adaptation principles of increasing tree species richness, maintaining and increasing genetic variation, and replacing high-risk stands. To address these shortcomings, CNS should make increased use of a range of regeneration methods, in order to promote light-demanding tree species, non-native species and non-local provenances.},

For perhaps 20—30 years, associated with concerns over apparently increasing biological and ecological problems (floods, avalanches, forest die-back, and other calamities) there has been an increasing debate in forestry centered on efforts to bring forest and woodland management back to more ‘natural’ approaches. Conservation and other management in parallel to these arguments are flawed unless based on sound conceptual foundations, and to this end basic principles and concepts have been developed. ‘Naturalness’ is one such concept. However, whilst this is an important term in helping to understand the key processes at work it has proved difficult to integrate with ideas of ‘close-to-nature silviculture’. This paper explores the issues and proposes more effective integration of approaches. Possible ways in which the concept can aid conservation management of woods and forests are suggested.},

Applying resilience theory requires careful articulation of the ecosystem state under consideration, the disturbances and stresses that affect the persistence of possible alternative states, and the spatial and temporal scales of management relevance.

Multi-aged forest management systems represent a promising approach for increasing resistance and resilience, thereby limiting major disruptions to timber production and other ecosystem services. Multi-aged stands inherently have greater resistance and resilience to disturbances because of the presence of several age classes and more potential pathways for post-disturbance management and recovery. The preponderance of research also indicates few differences in productivity between multi-aged and even-aged management strategies. These factors combined suggest that increased adoption of multi-aged management systems will lead to a reduction in long-term risks. We advocate a disturbance integration management strategy that encourages managers to emulate disturbance effects with management, anticipate disturbances in planning, integrate the management of residual stand structures into salvage operations and build variable treatment intervals or cutting cycles into management regimes.},

There is peril in making excessive use of buzzwords as stand-ins for the complex goals that are the real target of forest management. In this paper, I explore the consequences of buzzword mutation, which leads to paradigm creep—the use of buzzwords far beyond their original sphere of application. Such inappropriate use threatens to dilute the meaning of the original metaphor and makes talking clearly about the legitimate targets of forest management more difficult. I use “sustainable development” as an exemplar of a buzzword that has mutated into uselessness.

This paper attempts to evaluate (1) if and how emulation of natural disturbances (END) is being used as a conceptual bases for implementing EM, and more particularly, what strategies are used to define the natural forest of reference, and (2) what temporal and spatial scale strategies are being considered for seven important retention elements (downed woody debris, snags, green trees, corridors, riparian buffers, large patches and old forest)? To conduct this evaluation, five guides from four geographically well-distributed regions in North America are compared. Although END is the central conceptual foundation underlying four of the five guides, a natural forest of reference is not always clearly identified and none of the guides consider future impacts due to global change. The major weakness common to all five guides is the lack of consideration of long-term forest dynamics, particularly the lack of clear strategies for retention elements at a temporal scale longer than a single rotation. Generally, the spatial scales chosen for retention elements are not well-justified ecologically and targets for each retention element are not identified at different spatial scales. We stress that strong efforts have been made to develop forest management that incorporates some elements of natural variability and which considers societal needs, but further improvements are required. We conclude by presenting some suggestions to improve the approach. For example, creating more realistic guidelines in integrating current and future forest dynamics with pre-settlement information and planning rotation lengths that are inspired by the dominant natural disturbance.},

In the past there have been different interpretations. Leibundgut adopts a liberal interpretation, which he relates to primeval forests, whereby he accepts the use of all forms of regeneration, including regeneration on large areas. On the other hand, Möller gives a more strict interpretation based on successional processes.Nowadays the concept needs to be extended to include the importance of favouring diversity of forest biotopes and the potential for using natural processes for economic reasons. It is necessary to utilize a great diversity of silvicultural techniques, following Leibundgut's principle of 'free choice of fellings' (Leibundgut, 1949).},

	abstract = {Introduced forest pests add complexity to forest ecosystem management and can result in great economic losses. Introduction, establishment, and spread of exotic forest pests have been increasing at an alarming rate during the past 200 years. Because these pests have not coevolved with their hosts, they have great potential to cause widespread dieback and mortality. Silviculture is an important part of an integrated pest management program and can be a valuable tool in the prevention, mitigation, and restoration of forest ecosystems threatened by introduced pests. The current role of silviculture in managing introduced forest pests is evolving from one primarily focused upon genetics and tree breeding to a broader scope involving varying scales and strategies and a broad understanding of both host and pest ecology. Invasions typically occur as a progression through three phases: arrival, establishment, and spread. The appropriate silviculture option varies with the phase and the management objective. Eradication of an introduced pest is virtually impossible after the establishment phase. Silviculture during early phases may focus on more intensive or localized operations that attempt to eradicate or substantially limit the range of the pest. During the spread phase, silviculture is focused on preventing further spread by altering stand structures and tree species composition and improving tree vigor. In any phase, the silvicultural operations may be similar, but their timing and juxtaposition on the landscape may differ because of current status of the invasion. These strategies may include the maintenance and restoration of stand structures, enhancement of tree vigor, regeneration of healthy and resistant species, and timber extraction. These silvicultural treatments are similar in both their objective and the operations they require to address native pest problems. For either introduced or native pests, there is a need for development of new, creative silvicultural strategies that develop individualized stand prescriptions within the context of broad-scale management within an integrated pest management program.},

	abstract = {Silviculture is increasingly being applied in ways that go beyond traditional timber management objectives. Across the National Forest System, on other public lands, and increasingly on private lands as well, foresters are working with professional colleagues and landowners to develop innovative silvicultural prescriptions designed to meet diverse resource management objectives. Some of those innovations involve treatments, timing, or intensity that are not supported by published or ongoing research studies. This can lead to problems over time, especially if the treatments fail to achieve their intended goal. To maintain trust and credibility with other resource professionals, as well as with the landowners they serve, silviculturists must act according to a simple philosophy--say what you’ll do, do what you said, and watch what you did. A set of ten quantifiable metrics and subjective tools is suggested as a guide to implementing that simple philosophy. Taken collectively, this set of tools and metrics comprise a subjective decision support framework for silviculturists, especially as practices are proposed that go beyond scientific support in the literature. The degree to which these elements should be quantified depends upon the complications that will arise from failure to detect whether a prescription has been properly prescribed and implemented.},

	abstract = {Across forest ecosystems worldwide, alternative silvicultural practices such as partial or “structural retention” harvesting are gaining increasing use as means to balance economic and ecological management goals. Recent studies have documented highly elevated rates of residual-tree mortality and growth, both of which are likely to inﬂuence post-harvest stand development. Explicit consideration of residual-tree responses to partial harvest is therefore required to make accurate growth and yield predictions. In this paper we incorporate empirically based, spatially explicit tree growth and mortality predictors into a forest simulation model in order to quantify stand dynamics following a range of simulated partial harvests. We consider lowland black spruce boreal forests and use a common strip-cutting technique, Harvest with Advance Regeneration Protection, as a reference against which to compare alternative scenarios. Predicted stand development proceeded most rapidly in scenarios with reduced skidding impacts and relatively high levels of retention, since these treatments were associated with lower residual-tree mortality rates and larger growing stocks respectively. Stand development was also inﬂuenced on a proportional basis by residual-tree growth rates, which increased with declining neighbourhood competition. Across a range of harvest scenarios with equivalent retention levels (20\%), differences in residual-tree responses among treatments led to a 35-year range in projected basal area return intervals (70–105 years). Our results demonstrate that short-term responses of residual trees affect stand development rates over long ({\textgreater}100-year) time scales, and show that post-harvest stand recovery rates are inﬂuenced not only by the retention level but also by the speciﬁc parameters of partial harvest prescriptions, including the layout of skid trails and the spatial arrangement of residual trees. Results from this study provide essential information for evaluating partial harvests in the black spruce boreal forest and supply modelling tools for assessing alternative silvicultural treatments in other forest ecosystems.},

We use data from plots censused by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program during the years 2000–2011 to quantify relationships between two key aspects of climate—mean annual temperature and growing season water deﬁcit—and rates of sapling and canopy tree survival for the 50 most common tree species in the eastern United States. Our analyses include consideration of the effects of tree size, competition, and nitrogen deposition to avoid confounding effects and to provide context for the importance of variation in climate relative to other factors. Tree size and competitive effects, including the effect of tree size on sensitivity to competition, had the greatest impact on observed variation in survival for all of the species. Survival varied as a function of nitrogen deposition in 20 of the 50 species, and responses were stronger in saplings than in canopy trees. Despite clear sorting of the presence of the tree species along regional gradients of temperature and water deﬁcit, there was only modest evidence that either sapling or canopy tree mortality varied systematically along those gradients. For 24 of the 50 species, the most parsimonious models did not include either temperature or water deﬁcit variables. The exceptions to this were for several species of colder climates in which survival declined signiﬁcantly in warmer climates. In 40 of the 50 species, there was no signiﬁcant variation in survival as a function of either average growing season water deﬁcit or the most extreme individual growing season water deﬁcit during the 20 yr preceding the end of the census interval. The frequency of all but the most xeric of our study species declines at some point along a water deﬁcit gradient. But it is seedling survival (reported in earlier work), rather than survival of saplings and canopy trees, that varies systematically along water deﬁcit gradients.},

The equations address two problems that often arise in crown allometry. First, relationships between the main stem and the crown are likely to change with intertree competition. Therefore, explicit measures of density were used along with main stem measurements as explanatory variables. Second, the physiological relationship between CL and CRAD is often overlooked when modeling crowns. This relationship is incorporated through the use of a simultaneous system of equations. Parameters were estimated using nonlinear three-stage least squares (N3SLS) in which first-stage equation estimates of CRAD are used to estimate CL and vice versa in the second and third stages of N3SLS. The equations were fitted and validated for four species: lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson), hybrid spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. × P. glauca (Moench) Voss), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca (Beissn.)

We hypothesized that growth would increase with decreasing competition and increasing light availability, but that proximity to skid trails would negatively affect growth. A total of 300 sugar maples were sampled \$10 years after selection harvesting in 18 stands in Te´ miscamingue (Que´ bec, Canada). Detailed tree and skid trail maps were obtained in one 0.4 ha plot per stand. Square-root transformed radial growth data were ﬁtted to a linear mixed model that included tree diameter, crown position, a neighbourhood competition index, light availability (estimated using the SORTIE light model), and distance to the nearest skid trail as explanatory variables. We considered various distance-dependent or -independent indices based on neighbourhood radii ranging from 6 to 12 m. The competition index that provided the best ﬁt to the data was a distance-dependent index computed in a 6 m search radius, but a distance-independent version of the competition index provided an almost equivalent ﬁt to data. Models corresponding to all combinations of main effects were ﬁt to data using maximum likelihood, and weighted averages of parameter estimates were obtained using multimodel inference. All predictors had an inﬂuence on growth, with the exception of light. Radial growth decreased with increasing tree diameter, level of competition and proximity to skid trails, and varied among crown positions with trees in suppressed and intermediate positions having lower growth rates than codominants and dominants. Our results indicate that in selection managed stands, the radial growth of sugar maple trees depends on competition from close ( 6 m) conspeciﬁc neighbours, and is still affected by proximity to skid trails \$10 years after harvesting. Such results underscore the importance of minimizing the extent of skid trail networks by careful pre-harvest planning of trail layout. We also conclude that the impact of heterogeneity among individual-tree neighbourhoods, such as those resulting from alternative spatial patterns of harvest, can usefully be integrated into models of post-harvest tree growth.},

	abstract = {Robust predictions of competitive interactions among canopy trees and variation in tree growth along environmental gradients represent key challenges for the management of mixed-species, uneven-aged forests. We analyzed the effects of competition on tree growth along environmental gradients for eight of the most common tree species in southern New England and southeastern New York using forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data, information theoretic decision criteria, and multi-model inference to evaluate models. The suite of models estimated growth of individual trees as a species-speciﬁc function of average potential diameter growth, tree diameter at breast height, local environmental conditions, and crowding by neighboring trees. We used ordination based on the relative basal area of species to generate a measure of site conditions in each plot. Two ordination axes were consistent with variation in species abundance along moisture and fertility gradients. Estimated potential growth varied along at least one of these axes for six of the eight species; peak relative abundance of less shade-tolerant species was in all cases displaced away from sites where they showed maximum potential growth. Our crowding functions estimate the strength of competitive effects of neighbors; only one species showed support for the hypothesis that all species of competitors have equivalent effects on growth. The relative weight of evidence (Akaike weights) for the best models varied from a low of 0.207 for Fraxinus americana to 0.747 for Quercus rubra. In such cases, model averaging provides a more robust platform for prediction than that based solely on the best model. We show that predictions based on the selected best models dramatically overestimated differences between species relative to predictions based on the averaged set of models.},

With the advent of mobile terrestrial LiDAR, this ability has been expanded to include the rapid collection of three-dimensional models of large urban scenes. For all its usefulness, it does have drawbacks. One of the major problems faced by the LiDAR industry today is the automatic removal of outlying data points from LiDAR point clouds. This paper discusses the development and combined implementation of two methods of performing outlier detection in georeferenced point clouds. These methods made use of the raw data available from most time-of-flight mobile terrestrial LiDAR scanners in both the temporal and spatial domains. The first method involved a moving fixed interval smoother derived from the well-known position velocity acceleration Kalman Filter. The second method fitted a quadratic curved surface to sections of LiDAR data. The combined use of these routines is discussed through examples with real LiDAR data.},

Portable LiDAR height profiles and derived metrics and indices (e.g., canopy cover, canopy height) were compared among plots with different fire frequency and fire season treatments within secondary forest and old growth plots. The treatments consisted of transitional season fire with four different return intervals: 1-yr, 2-yr, 3-yr fire return intervals, and fire suppressed plots. The remaining secondary plots were treated using a 2-yr late dormant season fire cycle. The old growth plots were treated using a 2-yr growing season fire cycle. Airborne and portable LiDAR derived canopy cover were consistent throughout the plots, with significantly higher canopy cover values found in 3-yr and fire suppressed plots. Portable LiDAR height profile and metrics presented a higher sensitivity in capturing subcanopy elements than the airborne system, particularly in dense canopy plots. The 3-dimensional structures of the secondary plots with varying fire return intervals were dramatically different to old-growth plots, where a symmetrical distribution with clear recruitment was visible.

	abstract = {Aim This study uses the combination of presettlement tree surveys and spatial analysis to produce an empirical reconstruction of tree species abundance and vegetation units at different scales in the original landscape. Location The New England study area extends across eight physiographic sections, from the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The data are drawn from 389 original towns in what are now seven states in the north-eastern United States. These towns have early land division records which document the witness trees growing in the town before European settlement (c. seventeenth to eighteenth century ad). Methods Records of witness trees from presettlement surveys were collated from towns throughout the study area (1.3 × 105 km2). Tree abundance was averaged over town-wide samples of multiple forest types, integrating proportions of taxa at a local scale (102 km2). These data were summarized into genus groups over the sample towns, which were then mapped [geographical information system (GIS)], classified (Cluster Analysis) and ordinated [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)]. Modern climatic and topographic variables were also derived from GIS analyses for each town and all town attributes were quantitatively compared. Distributions of both individual species and vegetation units were analysed and displayed for spatial analysis of vegetation structure. Results The tally of 153,932 individual tree citations show a dominant latitudinal trend in the vegetation. Spatial patterns are concisely displayed as pie charts of genus composition arrayed on sampled towns. Detailed interpolated frequency surfaces show spatial patterns of range and abundance of the dominant taxa. Oak, spruce, hickory and chestnut reach distinctive range limits within the study area. Eight vegetation clusters are distinguished. The northern vegetation is a continuous geographical sequence typified by beech while the southern vegetation is an amorphous group typified by oak. Main conclusions The wealth of information recorded in the New England town presettlement surveys is an ideal data base to elucidate the natural patterns of vegetation over an extensive spatial area. The timing, town-wide scale, expansive coverage, quantitative enumeration and unbiased estimates are critical advantages of proprietor lotting surveys in determining original tree distributions. This historical–geographical approach produces a vivid reconstruction of the natural vegetation and species distributions as portrayed on maps. The spatial, vegetational and environmental patterns all demonstrate a distinct ‘tension zone’ separating ‘northern hardwood’ and ‘central hardwood’ towns. The presettlement northern hardwood forests, absolutely dominated by beech, forms a continuum responding to a complex climatic gradient of altitude and latitude. The oak forests to the south are distinguished by non-zonal units, probably affected by fire. Although at the continental scale, the forests seem to be a broad transition, at a finer scale they respond to topography such as the major valleys or the northern mountains. This study resets some preconceptions about the original forest, such as the overestimation of the role of pine, hemlock and chestnut and the underestimation of the distinctiveness of the tension zone. Most importantly, the forests of the past and their empirical description provide a basis for many ecological, educational and management applications today.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in using spatially explicit, individual-based forest simulation models to explore the ecological and silvicultural consequences of various harvesting regimes. However, simulating the dynamics of managed forests requires harvesting algorithms capable of accurately mimicking the harvest regimes of interest. Under selection silviculture, trees are harvested individually or in small groups, with the aim of retaining trees across a full range of size classes. An algorithm that reproduces selection harvesting must therefore be able to recreate both the spatial and the structural patterns of harvest. Here we introduce a selection harvest algorithm that simulates harvests as a contagious spatial process in which the cutting of one tree affects the probability that neighboring trees are also cut. Three simple and intuitive parameters are required to implement this process: (1) the probability of cutting a “target” tree (Pt) (often a function of tree size), (2) the probability of cutting its nearest neighbor (Pn), and (3) the total number of target trees to cut (Nt). Speciﬁcation of these parameters allows representation of both the spatial and the structural patterns of harvest expected under selection silviculture.},

Further, I conjecture that management aimed at quality improvement can achieve measurable results in yields and dollars at least as fast as management aimed simply at tons. In any event, land managers must be held accountable for quality renewal and not allowed to use improved technology as an excuse for high-grading. Managers should be setting “stretch goals” for quality in the annual cut as well as in the growing inventory.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to describe the trends of Vermont stumpage prices for major sawtimber species and products over the approximately last quarter century and propose a likely explanation of changes that we observed. Annual percentage rates of change (APR) were estimated for 10 forest products in Vermont from the third quarter of 1981 (1981Q3) to the ﬁrst quarter of 2007 (2007Q1) when the price series was discontinued. In addition, we tested for changes in the percentage rate within the period. We found differences in the trend of APR between hardwood sawtimber and softwood sawtimber. With one exception, price trends differed signiﬁcantly between 1981Q3 to 1992Q2 and 1992Q3 to 2007Q1 for inﬂation-adjusted (real) hardwood sawtimber prices. There were no differences in price trends for any of the softwood sawtimber species between the two periods. Real price trends for pulpwood and ﬁrewood were similar to those for hardwood sawtimber. We also examined stumpage price trends for selected species in adjacent New Hampshire from 1985Q1 to 2011Q1. Stumpage price trends for like species and proximate time periods in Vermont and New Hampshire were similar, but no statistical tests were done. The direction of trend (positive or negative) was the same for sugar maple, red oak, yellow birch, and white pine, and the magnitude of APR was similar for sugar maple, yellow birch, and white pine.},

Replicated treatments include the selection system, uniform sheltcrwood, unregulated harvesting, and diameter-limit cutting. The new cohort established under three-stage shelterwood was subsequently left untreated or precommercially thinned. Betweentreatment differences in net volume growth were not significant (a = 0.10), though gross volume growth differed significantly for managed vs. unmanaged, selection vs. shelterwood, and shelterwood vs. diameter-limit treatments. A three-stage shelterwood method with precommercial thinning 10 years following final overstory removal resulted in good control of hardwoods and hemlock and a dramatic increase in spruce and fir. The selection system on a 5-year cutclng cycle resulted In mcreased hemlock, spruce, and fir, with a decrease in hardwood species. If the pnmary goal wcrc production, even-aged management would most likely be preferred. We recommend a two-stage shelterwood method as applied in this experiment with some modification to improve species composition and stand quality. Stand quality (proportion of stand volume in cull trees) and species composition was influenced by treatment.},

Process-based models, which are based on a theoretical understanding of relevant ecological processes, provide a useful framework to incorporate specific responses to altered environmental conditions. As a result, these models can offer significant advantages in predicting the effects of global change as compared to purely statistical or rule-based models based on previously collected data. Process-based models also offer more explicitly stated assumptions and easier interpretation than detailed simulation models. We provide guidelines for identifying the appropriate type of model and level of complexity for management decisions. Finally we outline some of those factors that make modeling for local and regional management under global change a particular challenge: changes to relevant scales and processes, additional sources of uncertainty, legacy effects, threshold dynamics, and socio-economic impacts.},

	abstract = {Background: Growth and yield models are important tools for forest planning. Due to its geographic location, topology, and history of management, the forests of the Adirondacks Region of New York are unique and complex. However, only a relatively limited number of growth and yield models have been developed and/or can be reasonably extended to this region currently.
Methods: In this analysis, 571 long–term continuous forest inventory plots with a total of 10 – 52 years of measurement data from four experimental forests maintained by the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry and one nonindustrial private forest were used to develop an individual tree growth model for the primary hardwood and softwood species in the region. Species–specific annualized static and dynamic equations were developed using the available data and the system was evaluated for long–term behavior.
Results: Equivalence tests indicated that the Northeast Variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS–NE) was biased in its estimation of tree total and bole height, diameter and height increment, and mortality for most species examined. In contrast, the developed static and annualized dynamic, species–specific equations performed quite well given the underlying variability in the data. Long–term model projections were consistent with the data and suggest a relatively robust system for prediction.
Conclusions: Overall, the developed growth model showed reasonable behavior and is a significant improvement over existing models for the region. The model also highlighted the complexities of forest dynamics in the region and should help improve forest planning efforts there.},

	abstract = {Most studies comparing the predictive performance of distance-independent and -dependent competition metrics have been conducted in even-aged, single species stands. In addition, past studies have generally not considered more sophisticated distance-dependent competition metrics such as open sky-view or light interception indices. Using data from fully stem mapped inventory plots (n = 260) established in structurally complex, mixed-species experimental forests (n = 5) in the Northeastern US, we evaluated prediction performance of one- and two-sided distance-dependent as well as more conventional distance-independent competition metrics in both annualized diameter increment (n = 1735) and probability of survival models (n = 1953) developed across 26 contrasting softwood and hardwood species. Prediction accuracy of non-spatial and spatial models was further assessed by classifying observations by species shade-tolerance, relative tree height, time since harvest, and tree clumping. Our analyses revealed no general superiority of distance-dependent competition metrics over their distanceindependent counterparts for either diameter increment or survival, which was particularly true for the latter variable. Distance-dependent metrics tended to outperform distance-independent ones for observations from shade-tolerant species, trees of lower crown classes, and immediately after harvest. However, results on the comparative analysis of the predictive power of the different types of competition metrics under varying stand conditions and situations were often inconsistent and not always conclusive. In addition, model complexity, i.e. number of non-spatial explanatory variables in the base model, strongly affected the performance of distancedependent competition metrics. Our findings thus appear to support the critical assumption that distance-independent competition metrics are sufficient for most operational growth and yield applications, even in managed, naturally-regenerated and species rich forests.},

	abstract = {The Basal-Area-in-Larger Trees (BAL) is a measure of competition which is often used in individual-tree growth modelling. However, depending on the inventory design used for sampling the parameterization data, this competition variable is characterized by a specific resolution which has an effect on the model coefficients. If such an individual-tree growth model is used for growth projections, differing BAL-resolution might cause biased predictions of stand development. In this analysis, we used the individual-tree growth simulator PROGNAUS to display the source of this problem, and to test the simple method of tree record splitting to reduce this bias. Initial conditions for these growth simulations were obtained from sample plots of different size which were located in a larger stand. A growth period of 150 years was simulated for all sample plots and for the full stand applying the tree record splitting method alternatively. The results show that the change in the BAL-resolution, and therefore, the bias in the predicted stand development depends on plot size and on the length of the simulation period. Furthermore, the final diameter-distributions of the sample plots are significantly different from the diameter-distribution of the full stand showing greater deviations on small plots. However, if the sample tree splitting method is applied, the BAL-resolution can be held more or less constant during the course of growth projection and the bias in the predicted stand development is reduced. Moreover, the sample tree splitting method ensures that the final diameter-distributions at the end of the growth period closely match the diameter-distribution of the full stand. Thus, the proposed tree record splitting method is concerned with the problem of making a model more realistic from an ecological point of view, representing exactly the front line of today’s research in ecological modelling.},

	abstract = {Assessing forest productivity is important for developing effective management regimes and predicting future growth. Despite some important limitations, the most common means for quantifying forest stand-level potential productivity is site index (SI). Another measure of productivity is gross primary production (GPP). In this paper, SI is compared with GPP estimates obtained from 3-PG and NASA’s MODIS satellite. Models were constructed that predict SI and both measures of GPP from climate variables. Results indicated that a nonparametric model with two climate-related predictor variables explained over 68\% and 76\% of the variation in SI and GPP, respectively. The relationship between GPP and SI was limited (R2 of 36\%–56\%), while the relationship between GPP and climate (R2 of 76\%–91\%) was stronger than the one between SI and climate (R2 of 68\%–78\%). The developed SI model was used to predict SI under varying expected climate change scenarios. The predominant trend was an increase of 0–5 m in SI, with some sites experiencing reductions of up to 10 m. The developed model can predict SI across a broad geographic scale and into the future, which statistical growth models can use to represent the expected effects of climate change more effectively.},

	abstract = {Accurate and reliable prediction of clinical progression over time has the potential to improve the outcomes of chronic disease. The classical approach to analyzing longitudinal data is to use (generalized) linear mixed-effect models (GLMM). However, linear parametric models are predicated on assumptions, which are often difficult to verify. In contrast, data-driven machine learning methods can be applied to derive insight from the raw data without a priori assumptions. However, the underlying theory of most machine learning algorithms assume that the data is independent and identically distributed, making them inefficient for longitudinal supervised learning. In this study, we formulate an analytic framework, which integrates the random-effects structure of GLMM into non-linear machine learning models capable of exploiting temporal heterogeneous effects, sparse and varying-length patient characteristics inherent in longitudinal data. We applied the derived mixed-effect machine learning (MEml) framework to predict longitudinal change in glycemic control measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among well controlled adults with type 2 diabetes. Results show that MEml is competitive with traditional GLMM, but substantially outperformed standard machine learning models that do not account for random-effects. Specifically, the accuracy of MEml in predicting glycemic change at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th clinical visits in advanced was 1.04, 1.08, 1.11, and 1.14 times that of the gradient boosted model respectively, with similar results for the other methods. To further demonstrate the general applicability of MEml, a series of experiments were performed using real publicly available and synthetic data sets for accuracy and robustness. These experiments reinforced the superiority of MEml over the other methods. Overall, results from this study highlight the importance of modeling random-effects in machine learning approaches based on longitudinal data. Our MEml method is highly resistant to correlated data, readily accounts for random-effects, and predicts change of a longitudinal clinical outcome in real-world clinical settings with high accuracy.},
